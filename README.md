# credit-score-banking
This project is an assignment of the Data Scientist training program provided by Practicum - Yandex. 
This project prepares a report for a bank’s loan division to find out if a customer’s number of children, marital status, income level and purpose of loan have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. 
This report is the foundation to develop credit scoring later. Credit scoring is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.
The tasks include: identifying and imputing for missing values, replacing data type, identifying and dropping duplicates, categorizing quantitative and qualitative data (using quantile, stemming method), and find relationships between variables.
