## Introduction
- This project is an assignment of the Data Scientist training program by Practicum - Yandex. 
- It prepares a report for a bank’s loan division to find out if a customer’s number of children, marital status, income level and purpose of loan have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. 
- This report is the foundation to develop credit scoring later. Credit scoring is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

## Research questions
- Is there a relationship between having children and repaying loan on time?
- Is there a relationship between marital status and repaying loan on time?
- Is there a relationship between income level and repaying loan on time?
- Is there a relationship between loan purpose and repaying loan on time?

## Tasks 
- Identifying and imputing for missing values, 
- Replacing data type
- Identifying and dropping duplicates, 
- Categorizing quantitative and qualitative data (using quantile, stemming method), 
- Examining relationships between variables.
