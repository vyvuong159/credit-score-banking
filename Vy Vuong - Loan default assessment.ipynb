    "This project is an assignment of the Data Scientist training program provided by Practicum - Yandex. This project prepares a report for a bank’s loan division to find out if a customer’s number of children, marital status, income level and purpose of loan have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. This report is the foundation to develop credit scoring later. Credit scoring is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan."

Compared to people who are married, those who are not married have 1.22 times the risk of getting debt (not paying loan on time) (a 22% increase in risk), and those who are free from the bond of marriage have 0.86 times the risk (a 14% decrease in risk).</font> "

Because this is just descriptive analysis, associations are found by calculating some ratios and comparing them between categories. Results show on-time repayment of the loan are influenced by having kids, marital status, income level and loan purpose. Therefore, when deciding if the bank should loan a person, we need to relate to these determinants to reduce the risk of late loan repayment, or even worse, loan default. "
